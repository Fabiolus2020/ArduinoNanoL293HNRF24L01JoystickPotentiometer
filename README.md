# ArduinoNanoL293HNRF24L01JoystickPotentiometer
This sketch represent 1 joystick controlling motors direction 1 potentiometer controlling speed of motors while using the NRF24l01 and the l293Hdual bridge motor driver


Project#12

In this project I use a remote and receiver. The remote consist of a potentiometer that will control the speed of the motors and the joystick will handle direction. The IF statement valur for joystick are very high or very low cause I wanted to have repsonse that i trigger only when joystick is fully up/down or left/right

I did change the PWD frequency for better results
